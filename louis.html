                The subjects covered in a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) English course for visually impaired students would generally be similar to those in a regular B.A. English program. However, accommodations and specialized resources may be provided to support visually impaired students in their studies.<br> <br>It's important to note that institutions offering B.A. English courses for visually impaired students may provide additional support services, such as accessible textbooks and materials in alternative formats (braille, large print, audio), assistive technologies, and accommodations for examinations and assessments. These services ensure that visually impaired students can actively participate in their studies and have equal access to the curriculum.
